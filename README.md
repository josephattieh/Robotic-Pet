# Robotic-Pet

_Submitted on Dec 2019 for the course COE 521 - Embedded Systems_

# Requirements:

In this project, we are required to use the Robot 5 rover in order to mimic the movements of a pet. There are two main tasks in this project:
- Task 1 - "Keep distance": the robot must keep a fixed distance of 20cm between the ultrasonic sensor and a certain object.
- Task 2 - "Fetch the Green Ball": the robot must start from an initial position, look for a green ball, fetch the ball and bring it back to its initial position.

# Components
- PIC18F4550	
- Voltage Regulator	
- 16x2 LCD Module	
- Ultrasonic sensors
- Motor Driver UK1122	
- Rover 5	
- Raspberry Pi
- Camera 

# Main Highlights
This project was recognized for the following:
- The rover was operating accurately without the need of encoders for the motors
- It was cost effecient (e.g., instead of using Voltage Shifters, we employed built-in ADC modules)
- The ball detection system was real-time and resulted in the shortest fetching time amongst all participants (This project fetched the ball in 12 seconds  while the second fastest project fetched the ball in 25 seconds).
